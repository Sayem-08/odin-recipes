    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <h2>Sauce</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons reduced-sodium soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sesame oil</li>
        <li>1 Â½ tablespoons brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon rice vinegar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons chili-garlic sauce, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons creamy peanut butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Noodle</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 (3 ounce) Packages Ramen Noodles</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped peanuts</li>
        <li>2 medium green onions,thinly sliced diagonally</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk soy sauce, sesame oil, brown sugar, rice vinegar, chili garlic sauce, and ginger together in a small bowl. Add peanut butter, whisking until well combined, and set aside.</li>
        <li>Bring 4 cups of water to a boil in a pot. Discard the flavor packet and add ramen noodles to the boiling water. Cook until noodles are tender, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain noodles, reserving some of the noodle water in case you need to thin out the sauce later.</li>
        <li>Pour sauce over ramen noodles, tossing until well coated. If sauce is too thick, thin out with a small amount of the reserved noodle water until you reach your desired consistency. Your hot noodles will soak up the sauce. Garnish with peanuts and green onion, and serve.</li>
    </ol>
